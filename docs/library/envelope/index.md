- **[DetectSilence](detectsilence.md)**: Detects blocks of silence below the threshold value. Used as an auto-free node to terminate a Patch after processing is complete.
- **[Envelope](envelope.md)**: Generic envelope constructor, given an array of levels, times and curves.
- **[Line](line.md)**: Line segment with the given start/end values and duration. If loop is true, repeats indefinitely. Retriggers on a clock signal.
