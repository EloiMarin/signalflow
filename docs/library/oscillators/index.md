# Oscillators

- **[Constant](constant.md)**: Produces a constant value.
- **[Impulse](impulse.md)**: Produces a value of 1 at the given frequency, with output of 0 at all other times. If frequency is 0, produces a single impulse.
- **[LFO](lfo.md)**: LFO
- **[SawLFO](sawlfo.md)**: Produces a sawtooth LFO, with output ranging from min to max.
- **[SawOscillator](sawoscillator.md)**: Produces a (non-band-limited) sawtooth wave, with the given frequency and phase offset. When a reset or trigger is received, resets the phase to zero.
- **[SineLFO](sinelfo.md)**: Produces a sinusoidal LFO at the given frequency and phase offset, with output ranging from min to max.
- **[SineOscillator](sineoscillator.md)**: Produces a sine wave at the given frequency.
- **[SquareLFO](squarelfo.md)**: Produces a pulse wave LFO with the given frequency and pulse width, ranging from min to max, where width=0.5 is a square wave.
- **[SquareOscillator](squareoscillator.md)**: Produces a pulse wave with the given frequency and pulse width, where width=0.5 is a square wave.
- **[TriangleLFO](trianglelfo.md)**: Produces a triangle LFO with the given frequency, ranging from min to max.
- **[TriangleOscillator](triangleoscillator.md)**: TriangleOscillator
- **[Wavetable](wavetable.md)**: Plays the wavetable stored in buffer at the given frequency.
- **[Wavetable2D](wavetable2d.md)**: Wavetable2D
