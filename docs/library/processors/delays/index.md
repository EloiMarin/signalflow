# Processors: Delays

- **[AllpassDelay](allpassdelay.md)**: All-pass delay, with feedback between 0 and 1. delay_time must be less than or equal to max_delay_time.
- **[CombDelay](combdelay.md)**: Comb delay, with feedback between 0 and 1. delay_time must be less than or equal to max_delay_time.
- **[OneTapDelay](onetapdelay.md)**: Single-tap delay line. delay_time must be less than or equal to max_delay_time.
- **[Stutter](stutter.md)**: Stutters the input whenever a signal is received on clock. Generates stutter_count repeats, with duration stutter_time.
