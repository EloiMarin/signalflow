# Getting started

## Installation

SignalFlow is not yet available for installation via pip. You will currently need to clone the GitHub repo and build and run from the command line, which is hopefully a quick and easy process.

For details, see the README in the repo:

* [https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow](https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow)

## Examples

[Several example scripts](https://github.com/ideoforms/signalflow/tree/master/examples) are included within the repo, covering simple control and modulation, FM synthesis, sample granulation, MIDI control, chaotic functions, etc.
