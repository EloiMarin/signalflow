# Nodes

!!! warning
    This documentation is a work-in-progress and may have sections that are missing or incomplete.

A `Node` object is an audio processing unit that performs one single function. For example, a Node's role may be to synthesize a waveform, read from a buffer, or take two input Nodes and sum their values.

## Playing a node

To start a node playing, simply call the `play()` method:

```
>>> graph = AudioGraph(start=True)
>>> node = SineOscillator()
>>> node.play()
```

An oscillator node like this does not actually have a "playing" state. The `play()` method simply connects it to the `output` node of the current global `AudioGraph`. The next time the graph processes a block of samples, the graph's `output` node then calls upon the sine oscillator to generate a block.

`node.play()` is actually syntactical sugar for `graph.output.add_input(node)`.

To stop a node playing:

```
>>> node.stop()
```

## Inputs

### Node inputs
### Trigger inputs
### Buffer inputs

## Channel upmixing
## Triggers
## Buffers

## Monitoring node values

To monitor the output of a node, call `node.poll(num_seconds)`, where `num_seconds` is the interval between messages. This will print the last sample generated by the node to `stdout`. In the case of multichannel nodes, only the first channel's value is printed.

```
>>> a = Counter(Impulse(1))
>>> a.poll(1)
>>> a.play()
counter: 0.00000
counter: 1.00000
counter: 2.00000
```

To stop polling a node, call `node.poll(0)`.
